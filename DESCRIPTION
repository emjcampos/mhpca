Description: The mhpca package contains functions for performing Multilevel 
    Hybrid Principal Components Analysis (M-HPCA) as proposed in Campos et al. 
    202?, which decomposes multilevel region-referenced functional data into 
    between- and within-subjects principal directions of variation in the 
    regional and functional dimensions separately. This has been used to study 
    ERP data collected from multiple scalp locations across visits or 
    experimental conditions in Campos et al. 202?.
